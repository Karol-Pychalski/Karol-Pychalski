# Hi, I'm Karol Pychalski

## Professional and certified Software Tester with focus on automation

My professional experience goes far beyond IT, as in the past I was a Quality Controller and Quality Engineer in several manufacturing companies, which definitely helps me now to be a better software tester.

My goal here is to share my knowledge and ideas, contribute something valuable to the testing community, and make contacts.
